# Number To Words
This project is a coding exercise I found in a really old notebook that I was using while I was interviewing for my first dev job (Thank you Steve and Damien).

# Challenge
Write a program that will accept a 9-digit number and return the value written out in words. 

# Framework
.NET 8 Console App - Program consists of two files, the Program file that contains the logic and a NumberWords constants file that contains the strings used for the output.
